# default installation suggested on the homopolish github did not work
# due to issues with the version/channel of libedit
# flexible channel priority is required, but requires different export command
# to work with strict channel priority in snakemake

# this works, however it requires channel priority to be set to flexible before running mamba env create
conda config --set channel_priority flexible
mamba create -n homopolish -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c anaconda homopolish -y
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda activate homopolish
conda env export > ../envs/homopolish.yml

# rather than specifying homopolish.yml in the conda section of the homopolish rule,
# the actual homopolish environment is given
# this requires the user to run the following before running the workflow for the first time:
conda config --set channel_priority flexible
conda env create -f ../envs/homopolish.yml
conda config --set channel_priority strict
